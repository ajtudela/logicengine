Over the years I've tweaked the design of the LED and AVR boards slightly to help make assembly or manufacture simpler. Here's a rundown of all the variants!

##Original Run : December 2013
The LED boards are noticeably different from all the other runs. In an effort to keep pricing down I made them modular, so the rear logic LED board is actually made up of two 48 LED boards soldered together. The fronts are the same 48 LED boards, though only 40 of those are actually used (the AVR board tells one row from each board to sit it out). These were all Oshpark purple boards, and the back of the boards sported the Royal Engineers of Naboo (REON) logo.

##Run II : The Sequel : September 2014
This time around the modular idea was scrapped. The rear logic LED board became a single PCB with 96 LEDs and Kenny's photo/McQuarrie artwork on the back. The front LED logic LED boards became a little smaller and have C3PO artwork on the back. Plastics and hardware also changed slightly this run - since the LED boards were more symmetrical some of the plastics no longer needed the cuts to indicate orientation.

##Run III : The Revengening! : June 2015
For this run the front LED boards were made slightly smaller to try and help with difficulties that some builders were having with mounting the previous version. In many cases the front logics get mounted so close together that there's just not enough space to have them both on top of each other; so a tiny amount was trimmed from the bottom of the front LED board to help with this. The rear LED board and AVR board remained unchanged.

##Run III : Directors Cut : Coming Soon
In the middle of the third run I took a break to move house and also took the opportunity to make more tweaks! I made the front LED boards smaller yet again, sacrificing symmetry in the process and requiring a new "front inner bezel" to match. The AVR board also had a design change, this time to facilitate the manufacturer a little better - functionality-wise everything remains the same with it. The rear logic LED board still remained the same as Run II.

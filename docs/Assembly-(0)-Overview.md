The circuit boards come fully assembled, but you'll need to spend a little time putting them together with the fiber optics before they're ready to be installed in your dome. Assembly is simple, but can take a little time so set an evening aside to get everything together. The general procedure is...

 * Inner screen, inner bezel and outer bezel are attached to the LED boards using screws and spacers.
 * Fiber-optic cable is threaded through the outer bezel and into the inner bezel so it points directly at an LED.
 * Once positioned the fiber-optic cable is trimmed to size at the outer bezel.

*!* Never connect or disconnect LED boards from the AVR boards while powered; doing so can kill LEDs!

*!* The plastic bezels are laser-cut and holes have a slight taper. This results in the openings of the "fiber holes" being slightly larger in diameter on one side. When assembling the bezels & screens these larger openings should face outward to make inserting the fiber-optic cable simpler.

*!* Mounting the AVR board to the back of an LED board can create a short if not done carefully. To be safe, trim down the back of the soldered Teeces pins so they're almost flush with the PCB surface, then cover them with a small piece of electrical tape. You may want to do the same with the OUT pins of the LED boards as an extra precaution.

#Changes to Kits
##June 2015 Kits
The June 2015 Kits are almost identical to the Sept 2014 ones. Instead of a 16mm screw there's now a 20mm screw, and an extra nut and washer. The longer screw together with a washer and nut hold the Rear inner bezel to the inner screen, preventing the plastic from bowing out during assembly. Front LED PCB's and now a hair smaller to make mounting in the dome easier (boards are less likely to bump into each other).
##September 2014 Kits
The plastics and hardware of the newer kits were changed slightly to simplify assembly. Rear LED PCB is now a single board rather than two PCBs soldered together. Front LED boards now have 40 LEDs; the unused top/bottom row of 8 LEDs has been removed. 

Below is the Sept 2014 Assembly Video, which is also very relevant to the current kits...
